# `=this.file.name`

Ysenas was once a stronghold setup by Nelarion as a foothold in main continent of Axirune. After many years of war, Aslenasin was forced to admit defeat, sacrificing majority of their land in the process. Now the 2 nations sit with relative harmony. Ysenas sits as a major trade centre between the Nelarion home lands and Axirune.

Ysenas now sits as the Nelarion capitol, housing their seat of governance as well as being the place to be for trade and finding your wealth. Lacking in a central peace-keeping force, it instead uses a Mercenary Corp known as the Nid LÃ³ I-Axani, an offshoot group of the Axani Senate. 

Majority of trade within Ysenas is overseen by the Sails of Fortune. A Mercantile guild that found its wealth within the Nelarion heart lands, and played a major role in financing the original war efforts. As a result Sails of Fortune has earned a reputation of being the reason the original war efforts succeeded, giving them near unlimited freedom on how they enforce trade throughout Ysenas.
