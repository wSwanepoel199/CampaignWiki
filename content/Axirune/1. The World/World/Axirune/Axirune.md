His Majesty, King Anselm Godfrey, Eldest son of the late Slek Godfrey, founder of the Kingdom of Slek. Had been found dead in his throne room, a golden dragon born found attempting to resuscitate the now late king. Investigations had shown that an mystical force had targeted Anselm and discussions with the Dragon-kin had resulted in an unfinished debate over recent elven rituals. Due to the king having no known heirs and the loyalty the golden dragon-kin had shown to his highness and respect the king shared in turn, the courts had decided he is to ascend to the throne.

It was not a month after coronation that the war with the elves began, The now king released all information regarding the late kings demise immediately gaining the publics support. 20 years in drastic changes had been made the courts had been disbanded entirely, say for a select few hand picked individuals. And slavery of anyone marked as traitors to the kingdom had become common place, within 10 years suspicions of treason was all that was needed, and within 2 more slavery had become a common trade used to exploit, harass and abuse any who was not human or showed direct support to the new kings rule.

100 years after the start of this war, the situations have not improved, notions to remove magic from the general public had come back to bite slek in the ass as they are incapable of competing with the nature and arcane magics of the elves, as such new initiatives had been put in place, any who was gifted in the arcane or had the aptitude to learn either got conscripted into the military or was placed under strict restrictions with very little in the way of hard rules allowing for even more exploitation by the powerful while those less fortunate are forced to live in fear or have their whole lives constantly be recorded.
It is in these times we find our party, complete strangers about to be brought together by mysterious forces. Each finding their way to the old town of Wilwood, named for the Willow Tree that the town had been built around, invaded by Slek forced half way through the war, many changes had taken place. It is here these strangers will be tested, and perhaps even learn
